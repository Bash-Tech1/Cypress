# Project 1: Cypress Testing Playground 🧪

Welcome to the **Cypress Testing Playground**! This project is designed to help students learn and practice automated testing using **Cypress**, a modern testing framework for web applications. The goal is to ensure that all parts of the website work as expected by writing and running automated tests.

## **Project Overview** 🌟
